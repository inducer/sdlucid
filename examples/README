This is a small demo of SDLucid functionality (and how easily it can be
used).

The font file was generated using:

  sdlucid_ripttf ttf=tahoma.ttf out=tahoma.fnt --alpha size=8

I cannot redistribute tahoma.ttf out of copyright reasons, but looking 
through your windows install should reveal you already have the file :)
