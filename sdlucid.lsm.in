Description: SDLucid is a C++ wrapper library for the SDL by
  Sam Latinga. It aims to not only be a wrapper, but also to offer a
  cleaner interface than the original SDL as well as more functionality.
  It offers a nice interface, fast graphics primitives (polygons, circles...),
  affine transformations on surfaces (i.e. stretching, rotation...),
  bitmap fonts, mp3, mod, wav playing.
Keywords: SDLucid, SDL, ixlib, c++, library, tools, stl, graphics,
  multimedia, X, sound, affine transformations, wrapper, primitives,
  mp3, mod, wav, game programming

Platforms: Linux and Win32 (w/mingw) tested, other platforms might work.
  sdlucid needs a strict-ANSI C++ compiler with SGI STL hash_map libraries.
  gcc 2.95.2 and gcc 3.0 are known to work, others might, too.
